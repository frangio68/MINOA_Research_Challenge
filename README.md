# MINOA Challenge Documentation and Instances

This repository contains instances of a *Non-Periodic Integrated
Timetabling and Vehicle Scheduling Problem* (ITTVS) with a mixed
fleet of electric and Internal Combustion Engines Vehicles (ICE).
The problem and this data has been developed by personnel of
[M.A.I.O.R. S.r.l.](https://www.maior.it) in collaboration with
personnel of the [Dipartimento di Informatica dell'Universita'
di Pisa](https://www.di.unipi.it) for the purpose of the
*Scientific Challenge* of the H2020 project
[MINOA - Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Optimization Algorithms]
(https://minoa-itn.fau.de).


## Contents

Three variants of the problem have been devised, of increasing
complexity, for three different kinds of participants: "Junior",
"Senior", and "Professional". Accordingly, the doc folder contains
three different files "Problem\_Description\_Junior.pdf",
"Problem\_Description\_Senior.pdf", and
"Problem\_Description\_Professional.pdf" which describe the three
(different but closely related) variants of the problem. The
unique file "Input\_Output\_format\_description.pdf" describes the
format of the provided JSON input files and required output files.
Finally, the file "MINOA\_Challenge\_Rules.pdf" described the rules
of the challenge (although these are of little use as of now).

The "instances" folder contains three sub-folders "Junior",
"Senior", and "Professional" that contains what basically are the
same instances, except restricted to the subset of the data required
by the simpler versions of the problem for "Junior" and "Senior".
In particular, the instances ... are those released during the
preliminary phase, while the instances ... are those released during
the final phase for the purpose of actual scoring.

No solution data, nor information about the challenge results are
released here; interested readers can refer to the appropriate
[MINOA web page](https://minoa-itn.fau.de/?page_id=921).
